## Jotali Decentralized Exchange on Ethereum
+ This app powers [https://exchange.jotali.co](https://exchange.jotali.co)

## Getting Started

## Gitflow Process

• Our `master` branch is always the version of the application which is running live. Our master branch is never touched or committed directly to.

• The `develop` branch is the main working branch of the application for launching new features. We hardly ever make any commits directly to this branch much like master.

• When creating or adding a new feature create a new branch and name it accordingly. When the work is finished submit a Pull Request or merge to the develop branch, review, and implement. All feature branches begin with the prefix `feature` 
Example: `feature/posting`


• For fixing bugs or addressing issues please create a new branch and submit a pull request accordingly. All bug-fix branches begin with the prefix `bug-fix`
Example: `bug-fix/discover-text`

The goal of this flow is optimize for code reviews and cleanliness. The more segmented and contained work we can do the better we can focus on the task at hand, accomplish it, and implement.

## Contributing
We intend for this project to be an educational resource: we are excited to share our wins, mistakes, and methodology of Solidity development as we work in the open. Our primary focus is to continue improving the exchange for our users in line with our roadmap.

The best way to submit feedback and report bugs is to open a GitHub issue. Please be sure to include your operating system, version numbers, and steps to reproduce reported bugs. Keep in mind that all participants will be expected to follow our code of conduct.

## Code of Conduct
We aim to share our knowledge and findings as we work daily to improve our exchange, for the community, in a safe and open space. We work as we live, as kind and considerate human beings who learn and grow from giving and receiving positive, constructive feedback. We reserve the right to delete or ban any behavior violating this base foundation of respect.
